# Load the company registration data (replace 'data.csv' with your dataset)
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Data preprocessing
# - Handle missing values
# - Encode categorical variables
# - Feature engineering (if needed)
# - Split the data into training and testing sets

# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
# - Explore data distributions
# - Visualize data to identify patterns and insights
# - Correlation analysis

# Feature selection (if needed)
# - Select relevant features for prediction

# Train a predictive model
# - Choose an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
# - Split data into training and testing sets
# - Train the model on the training data

# Make predictions
# - Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data

# Evaluate the model
# - Calculate evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared)
# - Visualize actual vs. predicted values

# Interpret the results
# - Gain insights from the model's predictions and feature importances

# Create forecasts for future registration trends
# - Prepare new data with future scenarios
# - Use the trained model to make predictions for future periods

# Communicate the findings
# - Create reports or visualizations to present the results
# - Provide actionable insights for businesses, investors, and policymakers

# Iterate and refine the model as needed
# - Continuously improve the model based on feedback and new data

# Ethical considerations
# - Ensure data privacy and ethical use of AI techniques

# Save the model for future use
# - Serialize the trained model to a file for easy reuse

# Additional tasks:
# - Hyperparameter tuning
# - Cross-validation for model selection
# - Handling imbalanced data (if applicable)
# - Feature scaling or normalization (if applicable)

# Example code to train a simple Random Forest Regressor
X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)  # Replace 'target_variable' with the actual target variable
y = data['target_variable']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print evaluation metrics
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")

# Visualize actual vs. predicted values (optional)
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel("Actual Values")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Values")
plt.title("Actual vs. Predicted Values")
